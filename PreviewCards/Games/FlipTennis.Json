    "Description":"Flip Tennis was the first real game I created and released outside of game jam projects which I had been doing for a few years up and till that point. It has quite an unfortunate story behind it released in Spring 2021 the game was intially released, following up on that a handful of updates were sprinkled after release adding more content in the form of courts to play and skins to use. Following its updates an unfortunate set of events we set in motion, the hard drive the project was originally stored on got currupted and the data for the project was deemed unrecoverable, the closest backup being a few weeks from launch with a lot of assets missing it was deemed to be not worth while restoring and so I moved on."
