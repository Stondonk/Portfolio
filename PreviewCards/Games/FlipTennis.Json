    "Description":"Flip Tennis was the first real game I created and released outside of game jam projects, which I had been doing for a few years up till that point. It has quite an unfortunate story behind it. Released in Spring 2021 the game was initially released, following up on that, a handful of updates were sprinkled after release, adding more content in the form of courts to play and skins to use. Following its updates, an unfortunate set of events was set in motion. The hard drive the project was originally stored got corrupted, and the data for the project was deemed unrecoverable. The closest backup being a few weeks from launch, with a lot of assets missing, I deemed it to be not worth restoring, and so I moved on."
