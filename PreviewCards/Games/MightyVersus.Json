    "Description":"Might Versus is another one of my LowRezJam entries and is created in the image of a somewhat recent title called Multi Versus, in which you play as a multitude of characters from across the WB / Warner bros universe. In this title, I seek to recreate the game's basic fundamentals in a much smaller screen resolution with lesser audio and effects, all running in JavaScript in the web browser. Honestly, I feel this was one of my best examples of my ability to work within limitations given the fact that the game doesn't feel too dissimilar to its original counterpart in only a handful of pixels."
