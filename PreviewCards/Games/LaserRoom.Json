    "Description":"This project was made around a very crazy game jam theme, that being a level from the video game Portal 2, specifically the one called test chamber 20. Originally, I had seen a mod for the game that converted a lot of its aspects into a collectathon platformer, taking inspiration from that, I tried quite hard to convert this seemingly simple puzzle level into an intricate and fun platforming stage that took full advantage of a new tool I'd been using at the time, the Godot engine."
