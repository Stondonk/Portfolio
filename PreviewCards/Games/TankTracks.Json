    "Description":"Tank Tracks was a game created for the LowRezJam 2021, a game jam made for creating games within the confined resolution of 64 by 64 pixels. This was my first time completing an entre for this jam as the previous year i had attempted to complete a project in a similar vain but had his the deadline and scrapped it. The Game at hand is quite interesting as the idea behind it works better ironically at a higher resoulution. Yet the principle of grabbing an enemy's projectiles mid air and flinging them back toward the opposing force was desinged around the limitations of the jam its place is better befitting a more fleshed out title come the day I revisit the idea if ever."
