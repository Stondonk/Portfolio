    "Description":"Tank Tracks was a game created for the LowRezJam 2021, a game jam that challenged participants to create games within the confined resolution of 64 by 64 pixels. This was my first time completing an entry for this jam, as the previous year I had attempted to complete a project in a similar vein but had his the deadline and scrapped it. The Game at hand is quite interesting, as the idea behind it works better ironically at a higher resolution. Yet the principle of grabbing an enemy's projectiles mid-air and flinging them back toward the opposing force was designed around the limitations of the jam. Its place is better suited to a more fleshed-out title, come the day I revisit the idea, if ever."
