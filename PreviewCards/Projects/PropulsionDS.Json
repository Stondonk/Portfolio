    "Description":"Propulsion DS was original a game idea I proposed to the creator of the original game one night whilst drunken in a pub, after explaining all the requirements that would be needed for a very basic version of propulsion to be made I know it was possible on lesser hardware, I felt I had to act on this, so the following september around the creators birthday I set to work and created Propulsion DS. Created using the DevKitPro DS, a piece of kit designed for compiling C++ applications to Nintendo DS roms, fortunately, the api its subsequent setup were not too dissimilar to a much older open gl version. Creating assets and environments was still relatively easy, and in the end was based around a text-based file system that relied on the DS's internal Nitro file system."
