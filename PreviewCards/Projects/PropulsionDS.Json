    "Description":"Propulsion DS was original a game idea I proposed to the creator of the original game one night whilst drunken in a pub, after explaining all the requirements that would be needed for a very basic version of propulsion to be made I know it was possible on lesser hardware, I felt I had to act on this, so the following september around the creators birthday I set to work and created Propulsion DS. Created using the DevKitPro Ds set up for compiling C++ applications to Nintendo DS roms, unfortunatley the api and set up was not to dissimilar to a much much older open gl version to create assets and enviroments was still relativley easy."
