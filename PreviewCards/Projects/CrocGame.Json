    "Description":"Croc game was my first real project created entirely within C++ and the graphics library Raylib, it was made for a college project originally, to showcase what I could do at the time but since has become a reminder of how far I've come in such a short time. The game was the first time I really applied my ability and knowledge for creating programs from the ground up and is one of my favourites."
